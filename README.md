# ThemePackTransformer

A shell script to transfer windows themepack(both .themepack and deskthemepack) into gnome slideshow wallpapers.

Usage: ThemePackTransformer.sh your_themepack

To use this, you need cabextract installed.

Some features will be added, such as more powerful and friendly error handling, many thmepack into one slideshow, etc. And there is some ugly code, it would be nice if you can help me with that.
